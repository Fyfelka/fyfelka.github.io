For network equipment I use MikroTik hEX and Keenetic Air.
In the future hopefully networking will be moved entirely to Mikrotik, which needs PoE support and CAPs for Wi-Fi, and second server would be setup with Google/Oracle Free Tiers to simplify tests and improve stability of important services.
