## Who am I?

My name is Fyfelka, I've been working in IT industry since 2019, from IT support to system administrator. Nowadays I'm looking to move into more dedicated roles, primarily in CyberSecurity. I spend most of my free time playing games, contributing to Open-Source development and studying in networking and cybersec. I also self-host some personally useful services on some of the lightest VPS available.


## What should you expect from this blog?

I'm making this blog to keep notes on my progress, centralize stuff I deem important and maybe help someone down the line. Most of my content is split into 3 categories:

 1. Deep Dives - condensed information-heavy post about very specific topic.
 2. Learning Logs - shorter, lighter posts about doing courses and studying materials for certifications.
 3. CyberSec news.
